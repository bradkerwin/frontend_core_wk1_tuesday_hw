                    It's always important to fuel your body properly before exercising to your maximize energy levels. You do not want to eat too much before a run as will be too difficult for your body to handle and you will likely cramp up. A simple, nutritious meal consisting of protein and carbs will give you the energy you need to have a great run. Just be sure to watch your portion size and stop eating before you feel full. Allow your body at least 1-2 hours to digest the food before beginning your run.

                    You want to always stay hydrated regardless, but this is especially important when it comes to exercise. Drinking too much water too fast can cause bloating, stomach cramps, and it won't hydrate you any faster. Too little water can lead to dehydration. It is ideal to drink water periodically throughout the day and to drink it slowly to prevent bloating and maximize hydration. Pay attention to feeling of thirst and to the color of your urine to assure adequate water intake.

                    Dynamic stretching is your best friend before going for a run. This is the ideal method to warm up your body and minimize injury. High kicks, lunges, and jumping jacks are just a few examples of dynamic stretches to perform before running. Do this for roughly 5-10 minutes beforehand to maximize what you get out of your runs.
